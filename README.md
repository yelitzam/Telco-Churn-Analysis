# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company by analyzing various customer attributes
and behaviors. The dataset includes information such as customer tenure, contract details, and cost. 
The goal is to analyze the features that are associated with customer churn and to develop recommendations 
based on predictive modeling.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning steps were performed using Python and various libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, and 
numpy. Notable steps include handling missing values, dropping the CustomerID column as it was not informative to the data, and converting categorical features 
into a numerical format.

## Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the relationships between different features and customer churn.
Conclusions and recommendations were drawn based on the analysis of contract types, numerical features, monthly charges, and more.
